                    <p>Intelligent Sensors: Smart security systems employ a range of intelligent sensors, such as motion detectors, door/window sensors, and surveillance cameras. These sensors continuously monitor the environment and can detect any unusual activity or intrusion.

                        Connectivity and Communication: The sensors and devices in the smart security system are interconnected through the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. They communicate with each other and with a central hub or a cloud-based platform.
